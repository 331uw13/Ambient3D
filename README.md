### 3D Game engine built on top of raylib and ASIO

* https://www.raylib.com/
* https://think-async.com/Asio/


```
The idea is to create easy to use cross-platform 3D game engine library
which still has easy access to lower level OpenGL calls.
Optimized rendering and multiplayer support

... Work in progress
